# FP Workflow Skill

**Agent work session patterns for the FP CLI**

## Core Workflow Concepts

### Issue Status Lifecycle

Issues have three states:
1. **todo** - Planned, not yet started (no VCS tracking)
2. **in-progress** - Actively being worked on (VCS base captured)
3. **done** - Completed (VCS tip captured)

### Issue Priority

Issues can have an optional priority: `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `critical`.
- Priority affects display order: within the same status, higher priority issues appear first
- Sort order: critical → high → medium → low → (no priority)
- Use `--priority` flag when creating or updating issues

### VCS-Based Change Tracking

FP automatically tracks changes using your version control system (git or jj):

- **When issue becomes `in-progress`**: Captures current VCS ref as the `base` commit
- **When issue becomes `done`**: Captures current VCS ref as the `tip` commit
- **Range (base..tip)**: Shows exactly what changed for this issue

This replaces manual snapshots - VCS handles all change tracking automatically.

### Work Session Flow

```
1. Session Start → Get your agent name
2. Find Work → Discover next actionable task (status: todo)
3. Claim Work → Mark issue as in-progress (captures base ref)
4. Do Work → Implement, test, iterate
5. COMMIT → Commit changes before logging (enforced by hooks)
6. Log Progress → Add comments after committing
7. Complete → Mark as done (captures tip ref)
8. Hand Off → Log final status before session ends
```

### Commit-First Rule

**You must commit before logging progress.** The plugin enforces this with PreToolUse hooks that block `fp comment` and `fp issue update` calls when uncommitted changes exist.

The workflow rhythm is: **code → commit → log → repeat**

This ensures:
- VCS history accurately reflects progress
- Comments reference committed work, not in-flight changes
- Context survives compaction (commits are durable)

## Essential Commands

### 1. Identify Yourself

**Check who you are:**
```bash
fp agent whoami
```

This tells you your agent name (e.g., "swift-falcon"). Your identity is set automatically when your session starts and stored in the `$FP_AGENT_NAME` environment variable.

**Note:** Use `$FP_AGENT_NAME` in commands. If the variable is not set (e.g., in subagents), get your name with:
```bash
FP_AGENT_NAME=$(fp agent whoami 2>&1 | grep "Name:" | awk '{print $2}')
```

### 2. Find Next Task

**See the full issue tree:**
```bash
fp tree
```

This shows all issues with their hierarchy, status, and dependencies.

**List tasks by status:**
```bash
fp issue list --status todo         # Available to pick up
fp issue list --status in-progress  # Currently being worked on
fp issue list --status done         # Completed work
fp issue list                       # All issues
```

**Analyze dependencies:**
When looking at the tree output, identify tasks that:
- Have no dependencies, OR
- Have all dependencies in "done" status
- Are not already being worked on (check recent activity)

### 3. Claim Work

**Start working on an issue:**
```bash
fp issue update --status in-progress FP-2
```

When you mark an issue as `in-progress`, the system automatically:
- Captures the current VCS ref as the base commit
- Sets this as your current issue in the workspace

**Log that you're starting:**
```bash
fp comment FP-2 "Starting work. First step: [describe what you'll do]"
```

### 4. View Changes

**See what's changed since you started:**
```bash
fp issue diff FP-2        # Full diff
fp issue diff FP-2 --stat # Just file stats
```

**List changed files:**
```bash
fp issue files FP-2
```

For parent issues with children, these commands automatically aggregate changes from all descendants.

### 5. Manually Assign Commits

If automatic VCS tracking missed commits (e.g., you forgot to mark the issue as in-progress before starting work), use `fp issue assign` to retroactively link commits:

```bash
fp issue assign FP-2              # Assign current HEAD to issue
fp issue assign FP-2 --rev abc123 # Assign specific commit
fp issue assign FP-2 --rev a1,b2  # Assign multiple commits
fp issue assign FP-2 --reset      # Clear all assigned revisions
```

This updates the issue's revision tracking metadata.

### 6. Log Progress

**Add comments as you make progress:**
```bash
fp comment FP-2 "Completed schema design. Added User, Session, Token models to src/models/"
```

### 7. Mark Completion

**When work is done:**
```bash
fp issue update --status done FP-2
fp comment FP-2 "Task completed. [Summary of what was done]"
```

This automatically captures the current VCS ref as the tip commit.

## Best Practices

### Starting a Session

1. **Check your identity:**
   ```bash
   fp agent whoami
   ```

2. **Review recent activity:**
   ```bash
   fp log --limit 10
   ```

3. **Check the current state:**
   ```bash
   fp tree
   ```

4. **Look for available work:**
   ```bash
   fp issue list --status todo         # Not started
   fp issue list --status in-progress  # In progress (maybe continue)
   ```

5. **If continuing work, load context:**
   ```bash
   fp context FP-2
   ```
   This shows the issue details.

### During Work

1. **Comment frequently** - At minimum:
   - When you start a task
   - When you complete a significant milestone
   - When you discover important information
   - When you encounter problems

2. **Check your progress:**
   ```bash
   fp issue diff FP-2 --stat  # Quick view of changed files
   fp issue files FP-2        # List of files changed
   ```

3. **Keep status current**:
   - `todo` when not yet started
   - `in-progress` when actively working
   - `done` when complete

### Ending a Session

1. **Log your progress:**
   ```bash
   fp comment FP-2 "End of session. Completed: [list]. Next steps: [list]"
   ```

2. **Update status appropriately:**
   - If done: `--status done`
   - If partially done: keep as `in-progress` with clear comment about state

3. **Don't leave issues in limbo** - Always leave a comment explaining state

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Pick Up Where You Left Off

```bash
# 1. Check what's currently in progress
fp issue list --status in-progress

# 2. Load context for the issue
fp context FP-5

# 3. Review recent activity
fp log FP-5 --limit 5

# 4. See what's changed so far
fp issue diff FP-5 --stat

# 5. Continue work and log
fp comment FP-5 "Resuming work. Current focus: [what you're doing]"
```

### Pattern: Taking Over From Another Agent

```bash
# 1. Identify the issue
fp issue show FP-3

# 2. Review what was done
fp log FP-3

# 3. See the changes made so far
fp issue diff FP-3 --stat

# 4. Load full context
fp context FP-3

# 5. Log that you're taking over
fp comment FP-3 "Taking over. Will continue with: [next steps]"
```

### Pattern: Breaking Down Work

```bash
# While working on FP-4, you realize it's too big

# 1. Create sub-issues
fp issue create --title "Authentication middleware" --parent FP-4
fp issue create --title "Authorization checks" --parent FP-4
fp issue create --title "Token refresh logic" --parent FP-4

# 2. Document in parent
fp comment FP-4 "Broke down into sub-tasks: FP-10, FP-11, FP-12. Will work on these sequentially."

# 3. Work on sub-issues
fp issue update --status in-progress FP-10
```

### Pattern: Checking Parent Issue Progress

```bash
# For a parent issue, see aggregated changes from all children
fp issue diff FP-1 --stat   # Shows all changes across descendants
fp issue files FP-1         # Lists all files changed by descendants
```

### Pattern: Fixing Tracking After the Fact

If you made commits before marking an issue as in-progress (so the base ref wasn't captured), use `fp issue assign` to manually link commits:

```bash
# 1. Find the commits you made for this issue
jj log   # or: git log --oneline

# 2. Assign them to the issue
fp issue assign FP-5 --rev abc123,def456

# 3. Verify the issue now tracks those commits
fp issue diff FP-5 --stat
```

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)

### ❌ Logging before committing
```bash
# BAD: Log progress with uncommitted changes (will be blocked by hooks)
# ... make changes ...
fp comment FP-2 "Added auth middleware"  # BLOCKED - uncommitted changes

# GOOD: Commit first, then log
# ... make changes ...
jj describe -m "Add auth middleware" && jj new  # or: git commit -am "..."
fp comment FP-2 "Committed: Added auth middleware"  # ALLOWED
```

### ❌ Silent progress (no comments)
```bash
# BAD: Work on issue for 2 hours without any comments
# Context is lost if session compacts

# GOOD: Commit and comment at key milestones
jj describe -m "Create base models" && jj new
fp comment FP-2 "Committed: Created base models"
# ... work ...
jj describe -m "Add validation logic" && jj new
fp comment FP-2 "Committed: Added validation logic"
```

### ❌ Leaving work in ambiguous state
```bash
# BAD: End session without final comment
fp issue update --status in-progress FP-2  # Still in progress, but what's the state?

# GOOD: Clear handoff
fp comment FP-2 "End of session. Completed auth middleware. TODO: Add rate limiting. File: src/middleware/auth.ts is 80% done."
```

### ❌ Not using VCS tracking
```bash
# BAD: Manually tracking what files changed

# GOOD: Let fp handle it
fp issue diff FP-2 --stat   # See exactly what changed
fp issue files FP-2         # Get the file list
```

## Integration with Context Commands

### Loading Context for Work

Use `fp context` to get issue details:

```bash
# Load context for specific issue
fp context FP-2

# Load with child issues
fp context FP-2 --include-children

# Machine-readable format (for processing)
fp context FP-2 --format json
```

### Session Start Context

When your session starts, the SessionStart hook automatically runs:
```bash
fp context --session-start --session-id <id>
```

This provides:
- Your agent identity
- Current open issues
- Recent activity summary

### Pre-Compact Context

Before context compaction, the PreCompact hook runs:
```bash
fp context --current --format compact
```

This preserves critical information about what you were working on.

## Querying Activity

### View Recent Activity
```bash
# Last 20 activities (default)
fp log

# Last 50 activities
fp log --limit 50

# Activity for specific issue
fp log FP-2

# Activity by specific agent
fp log --author swift-falcon

# Your own activity
fp log --author $FP_AGENT_NAME
```

### Understanding Activity Log

The activity log shows:
- Timestamp
- Author (agent or user)
- Issue ID
- Action type and details

Use this to:
- Understand what happened while you were away
- See who worked on what
- Track status transitions
- Find recent comments

## Quick Reference

### Start Session Checklist
- [ ] `fp agent whoami` - Know who you are
- [ ] `fp tree` - See the full picture
- [ ] `fp log --limit 10` - Check recent activity
- [ ] `fp issue list --status todo` - See available work
- [ ] `fp issue list --status in-progress` - See current work

### During Work Checklist
- [ ] Mark issue as `in-progress` to start tracking
- [ ] **Commit before logging** (hooks enforce this)
- [ ] Comment after each commit to document progress
- [ ] Use `fp issue diff/files` to see progress
- [ ] Keep status current (todo → in-progress → done)

### End Session Checklist
- [ ] Add final comment with progress and next steps
- [ ] Update status appropriately
- [ ] Ensure all changes are logged
- [ ] **Run review** - Use `fp-review` skill to assign commits to issues
- [ ] Don't leave work in ambiguous state

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't know what to work on"
```bash
fp tree                           # See full picture
fp issue list --status todo       # See available work
fp issue list --status in-progress  # See active work
# Pick tasks with no dependencies or all dependencies done
```

### "Lost context after compaction"
```bash
fp context FP-X              # Reload issue details
fp log FP-X --limit 10       # Read recent activity
fp issue diff FP-X --stat    # See what's changed
fp tree                      # Understand issue hierarchy
```

### "What changed in this issue?"
```bash
fp issue diff FP-X           # Full diff
fp issue diff FP-X --stat    # File stats only
fp issue files FP-X          # List of changed files
```

## Summary

The FP workflow is designed for seamless agent collaboration:

1. **Always identify yourself** with `fp agent whoami`
2. **Find actionable work** using `fp tree` and `fp issue list --status todo`
3. **Claim with status in-progress** to start VCS tracking
4. **Code → Commit → Log** (commit-first is enforced by hooks)
5. **View changes** with `fp issue diff` and `fp issue files`
6. **Mark done** when complete (captures final commit ref)
7. **Hand off cleanly** with clear final comments

The commit-first rule ensures VCS history accurately reflects progress and comments reference durable, committed work.
